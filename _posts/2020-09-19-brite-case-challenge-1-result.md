We are proud to announce the results of Brite Case Challenge(BCC). (Download the problem statement [here](/assets/ps/brite-case-challenge.pdf) ). The competition was neck-to-neck, and after thorough evaluation, we announce our winner as **Pranav KS** from **Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts**. Below is his analysis:

Solution- 
i.        Marketing strategy 1- Low Fee Installation (free for premium product purchases) 
ii.        Marketing strategy 2- Free Extended Warranty  
iii.        Marketing strategy 3- Free 'Security Counselling' for residential colonies, housing societies and townships.  
Reasons for the same:
1.        Extended warranty- If the product is solid, this way, the reputation of the product can be increased further and boost buyer confidence on the product and the brand.
2.        Low fee or free installation- Competitive pricing and strong consumer relationships are really important in a market dealing with security equipment.
3.        Free Counselling- Perhaps the best way to solidify sales deals. Consumers pan India will have different or varied concerns regarding security. This method will also give the company a better idea about how to boost sales focusing on 'individual zones of specific concerns'. For example, the key concern in Kerala maybe protecting senior citizens from any sort of harm, while in Delhi, the priority could be on women safety. It is a much more efficient method of market research. Working with the society members to raise awareness about common mistakes made during setting up security. It will help people be more aware about tightening security and chances of higher conversion rate to brand love is very much possible if the counselors are great advocates of privacy and security, and great salesmen at the same time. They can ask the society to quote a budget and they can come up with the best security advice(s) with the help of the same. The buyers will be at ease and this is a good strategy to hit higher sales.
 
Ways of catching consumer attention, boosting sales and promoting such strategies-
 
1.        Digital marketing strategy
Target age group while using google ads: 30-50  
i.        Medium of communication- DailyHunt, Inshots, Quora, Google and Facebook paid ads. 
ii.        Affiliate marketing- Freelancers/Affiliate marketers become the voice of your products and sell it to others in return for a small commission. 
 
2.        Traditional marketing strategy 
i.        Target audience- Concerned citizens of any age group 
ii.        Medium of communication- Local Newspapers and local magazines, niche advertising targeting tier 2, 3, 4 cities.   
iii.        TV ads is optional 

Costs and Return on Investment: There will be a spike in marginal cost but on successful implementation of the strategies pan India, all three strategies are capable of boosting sales and probably at a lower cost than digital target marketing and personalized ads. Using those methods will need a separate specialized team of marketers and outsourcing the same without consumer knowledge, even for their welfare is a breach of data privacy. The comparative differences in costs cannot be ascertained without looking at the companyâ€™s internal data.
